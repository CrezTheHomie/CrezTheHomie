- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CrezTheHomie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML/DL solutions in the audio space.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the skills I need to build an ASR. My first project to be completed will be an accent classifier for the English Language. I plan to follow that with an IPA transcription solution. Beyond that? I'd like to create open source applications to improve the lives of those with disabilities.

- You might find some work for Virtual Table Tops (VTTs) on here as well.
